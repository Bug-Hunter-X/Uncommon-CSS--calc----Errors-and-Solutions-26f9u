The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not defined correctly.  Another issue is that spaces around the operators (+, -, *, /) are mandatory.  Forgetting spaces can cause unexpected results or parsing errors.  Also, nested `calc()` functions can be difficult to debug and may lead to unexpected behavior if the nesting is too deep or complex.
